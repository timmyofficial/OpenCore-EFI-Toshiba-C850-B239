Make sure you have done the steps of making the boot file in legacy boot https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/mac-install.html#setting-up-the-installer (if you scroll down you will find something like legacy setup)
And i recommned getting High sierra from https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist This worked for me
Specs: i5-2410M 8gb DDR3 HD3000
If you are using some other variant of the Toshiba C850 With Ivy bridge Use This(This is an older version of opencore but should work fine): https://github.com/ZebyWebby/Toshiba-Satellite-C850-OpenCore-Hackintosh
(PLEASE PUT IN ISSUES IF YOU ARE USING THIS(I want to see people who actually use this lmaoo))

Doesnt Work:
